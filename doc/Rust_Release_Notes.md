# AudioLib Explorer release notes

## Unreleased: Plan B storage and shared migration (`0.6.0-dev.1`)

Development identity: program `0.6.0-dev.1` | API `/api/v1/` | schema 6 |
snapshot schema boundary 3..=6, subject to the complete format/capability catalog.
This isolated development build has not been published, deployed or installed over
the current application. A future release requires a chosen release version/tag and
the corresponding tested peer-version ranges.

- Plan B removes six persisted derived-token columns while retaining tokenization
  revision 3, all twelve logical FTS5 columns, full positions and document lengths.
  Schema 6 uses contentless-delete storage and the pinned SQLite statistics fixes.
- Client, CLI and server share compatibility diagnosis and the owned
  inspect/plan/apply/resume/verify/rollback executor. Version differences alone do
  not authorize rebuilding a library. Unknown formats block unsafe use.
- Migration preserves stable IDs, Metadata, annotations, references, scan history
  and unknown supported extensions. The explicitly authorized retirement removes
  `play_history`, `audio_files.play_count` and `audio_files.last_played_at`.
  Original playback data remains recoverable in the complete pre-upgrade backup.
  The p1 format declares play_history_retired=2; earlier unpublished p0 is read-only
  compatible and migratable.
- Playback events live only in client-local history.db, default 5000 per library.
  Local legacy history imports after backup and before retirement; server/snapshot
  history is not imported. Cache replacement leaves this independent store intact.
- AudioFile JSON/CSV no longer contain play_count; attributes no longer append
  last_played_at. New clients ignore these extra fields in old server responses.
  Existing server playback routes keep validation and no-write behavior. Deploy
  clients before servers: old binaries require the removed JSON counter field.
- Download/decompression counters and migration phases/counts reach the UI.
  Invalid checkpoints stop resumption; process-crash recovery is tested for copy,
  indexing, publication and rollback. Cache retries preserve the previous snapshot
  and leave abandoned jobs intact for owner review.
- The CR branch incorporates released 0.5.0, retains its Waveform cache management
  and same-revision replies, and explicitly tests both 0.4.11 and 0.5.0 legacy peers.
  It rejects stale/unbound snapshots, checks UPDATE OF retirement dependencies,
  binds recovery to actual tokenizer sources and admits settings mutations through
  the same peer-catalog check. See [the CR record](api/Search_Storage_B_CR.md).

See the [migration contract](api/Library_Migration_Compatibility.md),
[full-library measurements](api/Search_Storage_B_Integrated_Validation.md) and
[current validation record](api/Implementation_B_Status.md) for exact evidence and
remaining limits. Database timings do not substitute for the separate GUI or Mac
acceptance work recorded below.

## Previous unreleased baseline: upgrade recovery and integrated client/server

This candidate includes `origin/main` at `71bb1fd`, client integration at `c50bd27`
and server integration at `3eef19c`, followed by the upgrade and shutdown repairs.
The previously rejected `47ddd03` through `c0e8af9` builds must not be published.
That earlier baseline reported 0.4.11 during preparation; publication requires a new
shared program version and matching tag. Do not replace the published v0.4.11 tag.

- Existing writable libraries upgrade search text and FTS5 in committed batches,
  resume after interruption and retain one validated rollback backup. Local startup
  displays bilingual progress; server health reports the current phase and committed
  row count. Business endpoints remain unavailable until the offline upgrade finishes.
- Upgrade batches and graceful server shutdown check WAL truncation. Shutdown stops
  list Waveform workers, drains scans and snapshot jobs, then releases owned cached snapshots.
  Active downloads retain their files until their last reference is released.
- The latest client and server list Waveform changes are included, along with the
  current toolbar/focus fixes. ARM64 BM25 comparisons retain exact result-order checks
  while accepting the documented two-ULP numerical tolerance.
- Libraries, Metadata, annotations, scan history and preferences are preserved.
  API `/api/v1/`, schema 5 and snapshot compatibility 3..=5 remain unchanged.

Validation and build identity are recorded in [Rust validation](Rust_Validation.md).
The original Mac's performance rerun is deferred at the user's request. Search latency
has not met the complete **P95 latency <500ms for 1M+ records** acceptance criteria;
the recorded slow samples and pending full GUI matrix remain open. See
[known issues](Rust_Known_Issues.md) and [upgrade recovery](Rust_Upgrade_Recovery.md).
This preparation does not publish a GitHub Release or deploy the service on port 8790.

## Published v0.4.11

Release 0.4.11; the client, CLI and server share the same program version. Patch release on top of the published v0.4.10.

Versions: program 0.4.11 | API /api/v1/ | schema 5 | snapshot compat 3..=5

## Changelog

### Click-free seek, pause and stop

- The fade at seek, pause, stop and source-load boundaries is now an 8 ms raised-cosine envelope whose length is computed from the output device's sample rate (at least 32 frames), so both ends of the fade have zero slope.
- The previous fixed 32-frame linear ramp lasted only 0.67 ms at 48 kHz and 0.33 ms at 96 kHz; its corners produced an audible click on every seek, especially at 96 kHz.
- The audio callback still only reads atomics and preallocated state. Volume, channel routing, source positions and playback sessions are unchanged.

### Column widths stay after dragging a divider

- Dragging a column divider shortly after clicking it no longer snaps the column back to its default width on release, and the default width is no longer saved in that case.
- Only a genuine double-click, where neither click drags the divider, restores the column's default width.

### Seek loopback diagnostic

- The `seek-loopback` diagnostic example gained `--signal sine`, `--tone-hz`, `--source-rate` and `--source-channels` options, so it can exercise the resampling and multichannel paths, and it reports envelope corners (second difference) next to the test tone's own slope and curvature.

## Known issues

- The first Play after the output device is opened still uses a 5 ms linear volume ramp.

## Compatibility

API paths, the database schema and the snapshot compatibility range are unchanged, and the settings file format is unchanged. Upgrading keeps libraries, Metadata, annotations, scan history and preferences; runtime state stays in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/AudioLibExplorer/v1` or the existing explicit data directory. The Windows x64 portable package includes WASAPI and ASIO.

The Release provides the Windows x64 client portable package and Windows x64 and Linux x64 standalone server packages, each with a SHA-256 file and an allowed-field validation report.
